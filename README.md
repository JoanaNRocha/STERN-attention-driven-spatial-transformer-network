# STERN: Attention-driven Spatial Transformer Network for Abnormality Detection in Chest X-Ray Images

### Abstract

### How to Use

#### Requirements
This code was developed using a Pytorch framework. The file with all the requirements is included in the repository (*requirements_env.yml*).

#### File Structure
*models.py* - Model classes of the spatial transformer network implemented for attention purposes.

*loss.py* - Loss function developed for finetuning, using a scaling factor loss term.

#### Example
